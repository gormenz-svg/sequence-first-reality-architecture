# Mathematical Specification: SFRA Model

This document outlines the mathematical framework for the **Sequence-First Reality Architecture**. In this model, physical constants are viewed as parameters of a global computational process.

## 1. Sequence Density and Temporal Frequency
The fundamental premise is that "Time" is the perception of sequence processing cycles. The local clock rate ($f_l$) is inversely proportional to the information density ($\rho_{inf}$) of the local cluster.

### Local Frequency Equation:
$$f_l = f_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{2\Delta \text{Seq}}{c^2}}$$

Where:
* $f_0$: Base frequency of the Absolute Potential.
* $\Delta \text{Seq}$: Local sequence density (traditionally interpreted as gravitational potential).
* $c$: The maximum rendering velocity (Constant of Propagation).

**Insight:** Gravity is not a force but a **computational lag** caused by the increased workload required to process high-density data clusters.

## 2. The Singularity Limit (Buffer Overflow)
A Black Hole is defined as a region where the Sequence Density exceeds the processing capacity of the Structural Tier.

### Critical Stack Condition:
$$\text{Stack}_{depth} \to \infty \implies \text{Rendering} = 0$$

When the sequence enters an infinite recursive loop, the Space-Time Interface (The UI) fails to render the region, creating what is observed as an "Event Horizon".

## 3. Background Stack (Dark Matter)
The "missing mass" in galactic rotations is accounted for by the **Background System Processes** ($\Psi_b$). These are sequences that maintain the Structural Tier (The Core) but do not output data to the Electromagnetic Interface (Light).

### Effective Gravity Formula:
$$G_{total} = G_{visible} + \int \Psi_b \, dV$$

$\Psi_b$ represents the "Informational Weight" of the Algorithmic Invariants maintaining the galaxy's stability.
