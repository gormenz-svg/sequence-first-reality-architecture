# Sequence-First Reality Architecture (SFRA)

## Overview
SFRA is a theoretical framework postulating that **Sequence is primary**, while Space-Time is a secondary "rendering" interface. This model provides an alternative explanation for gravity, dark matter, and singularities through the lens of computational density and algorithmic constraints.

## Core Postulates
1. **The Sequence Invariant:** Reality is a stream of logical operations (sequences) originating from an initial potential state.
2. **Computational Gravity:** Gravity is not a force but the result of increased sequence density (sampling rate) in high-data clusters.
3. **The Rendering Interface:** Space-Time is a human-centric UI designed to perceive discrete sequences as a continuous fabric.

## System Layers
The architecture is governed by a proprietary set of **11 System Invariants** (Core Logic), organized into three functional tiers:
* **The Volitional Tier:** Initiation and direction of sequences.
* **The Structural Tier:** Management of constraints, balance, and invariants.
* **The Realization Tier:** Stability, practical execution, and feedback loops.

> *Note: The specific mapping and logic of the 11 Invariants are intentionally omitted to preserve system integrity.*
