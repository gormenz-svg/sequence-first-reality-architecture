# Design Philosophy: The 11 Invariants

The SFRA framework is built upon a self-correcting algorithm that prevents "sequence collapse." 

### The Principle of Differentiation
The primary function of the internal algorithm is to act as an **Isolator**. It ensures that individual sequences remain autonomous and do not merge into a singular undifferentiated state. 

### Disclosure Policy
The internal numbering, logic transitions, and specific definitions of the 11 Properties are classified as **Core Logic**. 
* Disclosure of the Core Logic could lead to "Model Collapse" or unauthorized replication of the system's balancing mechanisms.
* Interaction with this repository is intended for architectural analysis, not reverse-engineering of the Core.
