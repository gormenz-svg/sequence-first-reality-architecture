# Gravity and Information Density

### Computational Gravity
In SFRA, massive objects are viewed as **high-load data clusters**. To process the complexity of these clusters, the underlying algorithm must increase its "clock rate" (internal steps per perceived second). 
* **Time Dilation:** Observed as a byproduct of this increased local processing frequency.
* **Curvature:** A visual artifact of the interface attempting to align high-density clusters with low-density surroundings.

### Dark Matter: The Background Stack
Dark Matter is identified as **Background System Processes** (The Foundation Tier). It provides the structural scaffolding for visible data but does not output to the "Visual Interface" (Light). Its presence is felt only through its massive informational weight.

### Singularities: Recursive Loops
Black Holes represent **Critical Execution Errors** or **Infinite Recursion Loops**. When sequence density exceeds the rendering threshold, the Space-Time UI "crashes," resulting in an event horizon—the boundary of the rendered zone.
